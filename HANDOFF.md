# Handoff

Read at the start of every session; updated by the sessions as work moves (ADR 0024, skill `handoff`). A record only: nothing here is an approval or an answer of the owner, which count only in the conversation (ADR 0023).

## Waiting for the owner

- Pull request #61 (drop the phase 5 trial, keep the current merge policy; small bookkeeping, no separate review), head a48cd79: asked 2026-10-09; approval for the new head still to be given.
- Go for phase 5 step D (arena and ratings), asked 2026-10-09. Step E's light items were merged on 2026-10-09 (#58, #59; owner approved in the conversation). Left in E: speed regression check and docs-only PRs skipping heavy steps (heavier, ask first). Ask before any heavy work.

## Open questions

None.

## Follow-ups

- ADR 0023 still says the SPRT is not a required check, which is no longer true. The owner keeps the current merge policy (2026-10-09) and wants no new record; the line stays as is unless he asks for a fix.
- Record the CodinGame ranks of `uttt-v009` and `uttt-v010` when the owner reports them (skill `deliver-release`).

## Notes

- Phase 5's one-week trial is dropped (owner, 2026-10-09); the daily report at 06:45 Paris time, on Sonnet 5.5, keeps running.
- Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe strength work stays paused; no training or league run by hand.
